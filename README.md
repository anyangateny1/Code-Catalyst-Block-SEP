# SEP-UG-33
SEP Project Github

Github basic rules:

Work in seperate branch pulled from main linked to a ticket.

When trying to push to main, create a pull request.

  Resolve merge conflicts by rebasing to main (more relevant to end).

Pull request approved by someone other than branch-owner before push to master (shows evidence of acutal SWE work).
