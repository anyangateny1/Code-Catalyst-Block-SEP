# SEP-UG-33 Block Model Project

A C++ implementation of a 3D block model compression algorithm that reads model specifications and performs block fitting and growth operations.

## Project Overview

This project implements a block-based 3D model compression system:

1. **Input**: 3D model data with specifications, tag tables, and voxel grids
2. **Processing**: Block fitting and growth algorithm for optimal compression
3. **Output**: Compressed block format (`x,y,z,width,height,depth,label`)
4. **Validation**: Reconstruction verification to ensure data integrity

The system is designed with separation of concerns:
- **Core Algorithm** (`src/`): Block model processing and compression
- **Testing** (`tests/`): Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Build System** (`Makefile`): Cross-platform compilation and automation

## Building the Project

### Modern Build System (CMake) - Recommended

The project now uses CMake as the primary build system for better cross-platform support and modern C++ toolchain integration.

#### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.16+
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 7+, MSVC 2019+)
- Ninja build system (recommended) or Make
- Optional: vcpkg for dependency management

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and enter the project
cd SEP-UG-33

# Set up development environment (automated)
./scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh

# Or manual setup:
# Configure and build
cmake --preset release
cmake --build build/release

# Run tests
ctest --test-dir build/release

# Run with sample data
cmake --build build/release --target run-case1
```

#### Build Commands

```bash
# Linux development builds
cmake --preset debug           # Debug build (Linux)
cmake --preset release         # Release build (Linux) 
cmake --build build/release    # Build Linux executable

# Windows submission (choose one method)
cmake --preset windows-mingw   # Windows cross-compilation (CMake)
cmake --build build/windows-mingw
# OR (easier)
make windows-package           # One-command Windows .exe.zip creation

# Testing
ctest --test-dir build/release --output-on-failure
cmake --build build/release --target test-all

# Utility targets
cmake --build build/release --target run-case1
cmake --build build/release --target run-case2
cmake --build build/release --target format  # Code formatting
```

## Code Formatting

This project uses `clang-format` to maintain consistent code style. The formatting is automatically applied:

### Automatic Formatting

- **Pre-commit Hook**: Code is automatically formatted before each commit
- **CI Pipeline**: Formatting is checked in the CI pipeline to ensure consistency

### Manual Formatting

```bash
# Format all C++ files in the project
./scripts/format-code.sh

# Check formatting without making changes
find src include tests -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h" | xargs clang-format --dry-run --Werror
```

### Installation

If you don't have `clang-format` installed:

```bash
# macOS
brew install clang-format

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install clang-format

# Windows
choco install llvm
```

The project includes a `.clang-format` configuration file that defines the coding style standards.
cmake --build build/release --target lint    # Static analysis
```

### Legacy Build System (Makefile) - Still Supported

For compatibility, the original Makefile is still available:

#### Prerequisites

- g++ compiler with C++17 support
- make utility
- For Windows cross-compilation: mingw-w64

```bash
# Install dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian
make install-deps

# Build everything and run tests
make test-all

# Create Windows package for submission
make windows-package
```

### Windows Deployment

For easy Windows deployment and submission:

```bash
# One-command Windows packaging
make windows-package

# This will:
# 1. Check/install MinGW-w64 cross-compiler
# 2. Compile with: x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -static -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc
# 3. Create block_model.exe.zip with no folder structure
# 4. Ready for submission: build/block_model.exe.zip
```

### Running the Project

```bash
# Run with test data
make run-case1
make run-case2

# Or run directly
./build/block_model < tests/data/case1.txt
```

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite with two distinct test programs:

### Test Programs

1. **`compression_test.cpp`** - Unit tests for the compression algorithm
   - Tests BlockModel functionality directly
   - Validates compression with test case data
   - Counts generated blocks and output

2. **`validate_test.cpp`** - Integration tests for output validation
   - Takes compressed block output (format: `x,y,z,width,height,depth,label`)
   - Reconstructs 3D model from compressed blocks
   - Outputs visual representation to verify correctness

### Test Commands

#### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
make test-all              # Run all tests (unit + integration)
make test                  # Build both test executables
```

#### Unit Testing (Compression Algorithm)
```bash
make test-compression-unit # Test compression algorithm directly
make run-compression-test  # Same as above
```

#### Integration Testing (End-to-End Pipeline)
```bash
make test-integration      # Run compression → validation pipeline
make validate-case1        # Validate main program output with case1.txt
make validate-case2        # Validate main program output with case2.txt
```

#### Individual Test Programs
```bash
make run-validate-test     # Interactive validation test (stdin input)
make run-compression-test  # Run compression unit tests
```

### Test Data

Test data is located in `tests/data/`:
- `case1.txt` - Test case with smaller dimensions (64x8x5)
- `case2.txt` - Test case with larger dimensions (64x16x5)

### Example Test Output

**Compression Unit Tests:**
```bash
$ make test-compression-unit
=== Compression Test Suite ===
✓ Basic compression test passed
✓ Case1 compression test passed - generated 86 blocks
✓ Case2 compression test passed - output length: 2134 chars
All compression tests passed!
```

**Integration Tests:**
```bash
$ make test-integration
Running integration tests (compression + validation)...
✓ Case 1 integration passed
✓ Case 2 integration passed
All integration tests completed!
```

**Complete Test Suite:**
```bash
$ make test-all
# Runs compression unit tests + integration tests
# Shows comprehensive pass/fail status for all components
```

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

**Work in separate branch pulled from main linked to a ticket, spaces in ticket name separated by hyphen.**
- Format: `UG33-ticketnumber-ticketname`
- Example: `UG33-19-initiate-group-kick-off-meeting`

**When trying to push to main, create a pull request.**
- Resolve merge conflicts by rebasing to main

**Commit according to conventional commits:** https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

Common types:
- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation only
- `refactor`: code change, no new feature or fix
- `chore`: maintenance tasks (build, dependencies)

Examples:
- `feat: add Google login support`
- `chore: update React to v18`

**Pull request must be approved by someone other than branch-owner before push to main.**

### Code Quality Standards

Before submitting a PR:

```bash
# 🎨 Format code (required)
cmake --build build --target format

# 🔍 Run static analysis
cmake --build build --target lint

# ✅ Run all tests
cmake --build build --target test-all
